## Mother's apple pie

This is my favorite apple pie. You can eat it in the morning with your coffee or in the afternoon with your tea.

##### Ingredients
Dough
* 500gr flour
* 4 eggs (just the yolk)
* 250gr butter
* 1 vanilla (powder)
* 1/2 cup of sugar

Stuffing
* 4 medium red apples
* 1 table spoon cinnamon (grated)
* 1 shot of cognac
* 1/2 cup of sugar

##### Utensil
* Baking pan size 30cm x 22cm approximately

##### Preparation
* We need two medium sized bowls. One for the dough and one for the stuffing.
* We start by grating the apples and putting them inside one of the bowls.
* We add cinnamon, sugar and the cognac.
* We mix the ingredients well and we put the bowl aside.
* We take the other bowl and we put the flour inside.
* We heat the butter in low temperature until it melts. Be careful, it shouldn't be too hot.
* We pour the melted butter into the flour, we put the eggs, the sugar and the vanilla.
* We use our hands to mix the dough very well.
* We butter up the pan
* We separate the dough into two parts and we take one
* We take one part of the dough and we place it uniformly on the bottom of the pan. We must cover all the of the pan.
* We take the bowl with the staffing and we pour it in the pan and we spread it evenly.
* Finally, we take the other part of the dough and we try to cover the whole pan. We do this by taking small pieces of the dough, press it between our palms in order to form thin layers that we then put on the staffing. It's not a problem if we leave small gaps between the thin dough layers. The dough will grow bigger during baking and fill these gaps. If we cover the whole pan and we still have some dough, we try to fill in the gaps.

##### Baking
* We preheat the oven for 10 minutes. We use 150C on air and we bake for 60-75 minutes.

##### Serving
* We leave the pie to get cool and then we spread caster sugar all over the pie until we cover the whole surface.
